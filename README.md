# mnist-classification-via-svm

In this project I used support vector machine (SVM) to classify MNIST dataset which consist of hand-writen digits. In this project I used train-test split and k-fold techniques to evaluate my model serperatly. I also used multiple evaluation metrics such as precission, recall, and AUC. For svm I used both linear kernel and RBF kerenl.
